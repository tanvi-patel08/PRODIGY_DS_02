# PRODIGY_DS_02
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns and survival trends by analyzing relationships between variables such as passenger class, age, fare, gender, and family size. 

🔍 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
Perform detailed EDA to uncover insights.
Explore relationships between survival and demographic variables.
Build a 2-page interactive Power BI dashboard with page navigation button to present findings.
